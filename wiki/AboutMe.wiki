#summary All about me.

My name is Matthew Chudleigh.  Currently I work at the University of Southern Queensland as a programmer in the [http://www.alivex3d.org/ ALIVE] team.

In my spare time I am developing this Zombie game (among other hobbies).

I work mainly in C++.  I've played with Python, Ruby, Erlang, and Lisp.
